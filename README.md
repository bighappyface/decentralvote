Decentralized voting on Ethereum

ðŸ”— https://decentral.vote

* Poll contracts are based on Draft [EIP-1417](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1417)
* UI built with React
* Chain development with HardHat

## Why decentralized voting?

People should have control over their vote and have faith in any given election. This expectation is at the heart of democracy, and our most advanced technologies should empower us to have free and fair elections.

A public blockchain, uncensored and uncontrolled by a central authority, is such a technology.

This platform intends to demonstrate a path towards better elections for voters worldwide.
